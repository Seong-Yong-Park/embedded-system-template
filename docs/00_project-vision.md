# Project Vision

## Background
<!-- Background and necessity of the project -->

**Example:**
The manufacturing industry is increasingly adopting automated systems to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. Our current motor control solutions rely on legacy hardware and proprietary software, which limits flexibility and makes maintenance difficult.

**Key Drivers:**
- **Market Need**: Growing demand for flexible, configurable motor control systems
- **Technology Gap**: Existing solutions lack modern communication interfaces (CAN bus) and diagnostic capabilities
- **Cost Pressure**: Need to reduce system integration time and maintenance costs
- **Regulatory Requirements**: New safety standards require enhanced fault detection and reporting

**Problem Statement:**
Current motor controllers in our product line:
- Use outdated communication protocols
- Lack comprehensive diagnostic capabilities
- Require specialized tools for configuration
- Have limited scalability for different motor types

This project aims to develop a next-generation motor control system that addresses these limitations while maintaining compatibility with existing infrastructure.

## Goals
<!-- Main goals of the project -->

**Example:**

### Primary Goals
1. **Develop a Modern Motor Control Platform**
   - Support for multiple motor types (DC, BLDC, stepper)
   - Configurable control algorithms (PID, advanced control)
   - Real-time performance: 1 kHz control loop

2. **Implement Standard Communication Interfaces**
   - CAN bus integration (500 kbps, CAN 2.0B)
   - UART for debug and firmware update
   - Support for industry-standard protocols

3. **Enhance Safety and Reliability**
   - Comprehensive fault detection and reporting
   - Watchdog timer and safety shutdown mechanisms
   - MTBF target: ≥ 10,000 hours

4. **Improve Usability and Maintainability**
   - User-friendly configuration via CAN interface
   - Comprehensive diagnostic capabilities
   - Modular software architecture for easy updates

### Success Criteria
- **Performance**: Achieve target speed within ±5 RPM, response time < 2 seconds
- **Reliability**: Zero critical failures during 6-month field trial
- **Usability**: Configuration time reduced by 50% compared to legacy systems
- **Cost**: Manufacturing cost within 15% of current solution
